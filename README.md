# 📘 QA Theoretical Script - Learning Plan for Junior QA Engineer

This repository is a personal, thematic collection of theoretical notes and a structured learning plan prepared for a **Junior QA Engineer** role. Its purpose is to serve as private study material and interview preparation - a consolidated, organized set of summaries and working notes assembled from publicly available materials and original annotations.

## 🗂️ Repository layout - description

This repository adopts a topic-based layout: each primary area of QA knowledge is represented by a dedicated folder, and each folder contains one or more Markdown files that address specific subtopics. The layout is designed to be both a clear map of the intended curriculum and a practical workspace for ongoing note-taking. Files may be introduced as placeholders and populated progressively; this approach makes it easy to track scope and to iterate on content without disrupting overall organization.

Naming conventions - numeric prefixes are used for visual sorting and prioritization. File names follow a concise, kebab-style pattern (for example: `01-qa-basics/introduction-junior-qa-sdlc-stlc.md`) to keep paths readable and predictable. Each topic file typically includes a short summary, learning objectives, practical exercises, and interview-style questions for self-assessment.

Benefits of this layout include easier navigation of domain-specific content, straightforward extension when new topics are added, and clear separation between conceptual notes and practical examples or commands. The structure is intentionally neutral regarding study order - the numbering is organizational, not prescriptive.

## 🧭 Learning plan

This repository implements a structured learning plan intended for a Junior QA Engineer. Each topic is designed with clear learning objectives, recommended practical exercises, and examples of interview-style questions for self-assessment. The plan is comprehensive across the core QA domains and framed to support both theoretical understanding and hands-on practice.

Key topical areas:

- **QA fundamentals:** responsibilities of a Junior QA Engineer; differences between SDLC and STLC; test lifecycle.
- **Test artifacts:** test plans, test cases, acceptance criteria, defect reporting and defect lifecycle.
- **Testing types:** functional and non-functional testing; unit, integration, system, UAT, regression strategies.
- **Tools & workflows:** version control with Git; Linux command-line basics relevant to QA; issue tracking and workflow integration (e.g., Jira); logging and debugging with browser DevTools.
- **Databases & APIs:** SQL fundamentals and multi-table queries; API testing concepts and practices; OpenAPI/Swagger usage.
- **Test automation:** JavaScript essentials relevant to automation; Selenium, Cypress, Playwright fundamentals and trade-offs.
- **CI/CD & pipelines:** integrating automated tests into CI systems, pipeline test reporting and artifact management.
- **Performance & security testing:** load/stress testing concepts; OWASP Top 10 awareness; basic security test checks.
- **Quality & standards:** accessibility (WCAG basics), QA metrics, relevant standards and professional guidance (ISO/ISTQB references where applicable).
- **Practical techniques:** mocking and stubbing, flaky-test mitigation, test data management, and using Docker for reproducible environments.

Each topic file will typically include:

- A concise summary and definitions.
- Specific learning objectives.
- Practical exercises or commands to execute.
- Suggested interview questions and quick checks for self-evaluation.
