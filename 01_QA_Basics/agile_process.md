# Agile Process

## Introduction

Agile is a software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, close collaboration, fast iterations, and continuous improvement. Unlike the traditional Waterfall model, Agile focuses on delivering small, functional increments of software in short cycles called iterations or sprints. Testing is not a separate phase in Agile; it is an ongoing activity performed throughout the entire development process.

For QA engineers, Agile changes the way quality is ensured. QA becomes an integral part of the team, involved from requirement analysis to release, with a strong focus on early feedback, collaboration, and continuous testing.

## Agile Core Principles

Agile is guided by principles defined in the Agile Manifesto, which strongly influence QA work.

* Frequent delivery of working software ensures that QA can validate functionality early and often, reducing late-stage surprises.
* Welcoming changing requirements allows QA to adapt test cases and strategies as the product evolves.
* Close collaboration between developers, QA, and business stakeholders improves shared understanding of requirements and acceptance criteria.
* Self-organizing teams empower QA engineers to actively contribute to process improvements and quality decisions.
* Continuous reflection and improvement encourage teams to refine testing practices, automation, and workflows over time.

## Benefits of Agile for QA

Agile brings several practical advantages from a quality perspective.

* Faster feedback cycles help QA detect defects early, when they are cheaper and easier to fix.
* Continuous testing reduces the risk of accumulating critical defects late in the release cycle.
* Improved transparency allows QA to clearly track progress, risks, and test coverage.
* Higher customer satisfaction is achieved by validating functionality incrementally and incorporating user feedback.

## Agile Process Overview

The Agile process is iterative and incremental, meaning development and testing happen in parallel.

Key elements of the Agile process include:

* Iterations or sprints, usually lasting from one to four weeks, during which planning, development, testing, and delivery occur.
* Product Backlog, which is a prioritized list of features, improvements, and technical tasks defined by business value.
* Sprint Backlog, which contains the selected backlog items planned for implementation in the current sprint.
* Continuous integration and testing, where code changes are frequently merged and validated through automated and manual tests.
* Regular feedback from users and stakeholders, allowing the team to adjust priorities and expectations.

## Scrum Methodology

Scrum is one of the most widely used Agile frameworks. It provides a structured approach with defined roles, events, and artifacts.

### Scrum Roles

* Product Owner is responsible for defining requirements, prioritizing the Product Backlog, and maximizing product value.
* Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures that Scrum practices are followed correctly.
* Development Team includes developers and QA engineers who collaboratively design, build, and test the product.

### Scrum Artifacts and Events

* Sprint is a time-boxed iteration focused on delivering a potentially shippable product increment.
* Backlog represents all work items, including functional requirements, bugs, and technical tasks.
* Daily Stand-up is a short daily meeting where team members share progress, plans, and blockers.
* Sprint Review focuses on demonstrating completed functionality and gathering stakeholder feedback.
* Sprint Retrospective is dedicated to analyzing the process and identifying improvements for future sprints.

### Role of QA in Scrum

QA plays an active and continuous role within the Scrum team.

* Participates in sprint planning to understand requirements, risks, and acceptance criteria.
* Designs test cases, prepares test data, and ensures test environments are ready early in the sprint.
* Executes manual and automated tests throughout the sprint, not only at the end.
* Collaborates closely with developers to clarify defects and support quick fixes.
* Actively participates in Daily Stand-ups by reporting testing progress and blockers.
* Provides quality-related feedback during Sprint Reviews and improvement suggestions during Retrospectives.
* Contributes to defining the Definition of Done by including clear QA and testing criteria.

## Kanban Methodology

Kanban is an Agile framework focused on visualizing work and maintaining a continuous flow of tasks rather than fixed iterations.

### Key Kanban Concepts

* Kanban board visually represents the workflow using columns such as To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done.
* Work In Progress limits restrict the number of tasks in a given state to prevent overload and bottlenecks.
* Continuous flow allows work to move through the system without predefined sprint boundaries.
* Pull-based system means team members pull new tasks only when they have capacity.

### Role of QA in Kanban

* Monitors tasks on the Kanban board and begins testing as soon as items enter the testing stage.
* Communicates continuously with developers to resolve issues quickly and avoid task accumulation.
* Helps define and monitor WIP limits for testing to maintain a sustainable QA workload.
* Tracks and documents defects while ensuring smooth task progression.
* Supports defining clear completion criteria, including QA validation, before tasks move to Done.

## QA Integration in Agile Ceremonies

QA involvement spans all Agile activities.

* During sprint planning, QA evaluates testability, identifies risks, and estimates testing effort.
* In Daily Stand-ups, QA shares testing status, blockers, and coordination needs.
* During the sprint, QA performs continuous functional, regression, and exploratory testing.
* In Sprint Reviews, QA communicates quality status, test coverage, and known risks.
* In Retrospectives, QA suggests improvements in testing strategy, automation, and collaboration.
* Continuous collaboration ensures alignment on quality goals, test automation growth, and technical debt management.

## Conclusion

In Agile development, QA is not a separate or final phase but a fully integrated team responsibility. QA engineers contribute to product quality through continuous testing, early defect detection, and close collaboration with developers and Product Owners. Understanding Agile principles, Scrum and Kanban practices, and the QA role within these frameworks enables junior QA engineers to effectively support high-quality software delivery and adapt to fast-changing development environments.
